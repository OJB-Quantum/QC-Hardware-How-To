# Everything You Need for Experimental Quantum Hardware Engineering  
**University of Minnesota**

**Onri Jay Benally**  

This document is meant to provide some level of consolidation for those desiring to be involved with quantum hardware engineering. By doing one's best to maintain familiarity with these topics, it is possible to become one who designs, builds, tests, operates, and maintains real quantum machines - a quantum mechanic. Another possibility is to begin working on a doctorate degree in the associated field with these training resources on hand. There are many clickable links in this document, so it might be best to view it using a browser or PDF viewer.

My decision to share these resources is because they have been useful to me in my PhD work. This has been a very interesting path for me as a tribesman from the Navaho Nation. Here is the path: carpenter → electric vehicle researcher → nanotechnologist → quantum mechanic.

Please note that open access is a key theme held herein. Enjoy.

### Example of Linguistics Applied to Quantum Hardware Terminology

> Breakdown of the term **dispersion** and its connection to the **dispersive regime**, first from an etymological and linguistic perspective, followed by its application in superconductivity.

#### **Etymology & Linguistic Insight**

| **Term**         | **Etymology & Linguistic Insight** |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Dispersion**   | - Derived from **Latin** *dispersio*, from *dispergere* ("to scatter, spread out"). <br> - *Dis-* ("apart") + *spargere* ("to scatter, sprinkle") → meaning "to spread apart or distribute." <br> - Commonly refers to the process of separation or spreading in various contexts: optics, fluid dynamics, and waves. |
| **Dispersive**   | - Adjective form of **dispersion**, indicating a system or medium where different components (e.g., waves, particles) separate due to frequency-dependent properties. <br> - In physics, this refers to how different frequencies propagate at different speeds, leading to *wave dispersion*. |
| **Regime**       | - From **Latin** *regimen* ("rule, system, guidance"), related to *regere* ("to guide, direct, rule"). <br> - Indicates a domain or system characterized by a particular set of governing rules. |

**Linguistic Insight:**  
- The root meanings emphasize the **spreading or separation** of components (dispersion) under specific **rules or conditions** (regime).  
- Thus, a **dispersive regime** is a domain where wave-like entities (e.g., electromagnetic waves, phonons, quasiparticles) experience **frequency-dependent separation** governed by a particular system.

#### **Context in Superconductivity**

| **Concept**                | **Description** |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Dispersion in superconductivity** | Refers to the relationship between the energy and momentum of excitations (e.g., quasiparticles, plasmons, phonons, or collective modes) in a superconducting system. This dispersion relation determines how these excitations propagate. |
| **Dispersive regime**       | A regime where the propagation characteristics of these excitations strongly depend on frequency. In superconducting circuits, this typically arises when the system exhibits **nonlinear interactions**, leading to frequency-dependent phase shifts and group velocity variations. |
| **Example: Josephson junctions** | In superconducting circuits, Josephson junctions exhibit a **dispersive regime** where the nonlinear inductance causes frequency-dependent shifts in resonance conditions, critical for quantum computing and readout of superconducting qubits. |
| **Example: Microwave resonators** | Superconducting microwave resonators interact with qubits via dispersive coupling, shifting their resonance frequency depending on the qubit state—a fundamental principle of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). |

**Key Takeaway:**  
- The dispersive regime in superconducting systems **exploits frequency-dependent interactions** to enable **state-dependent measurements, non-demolition readout, and coherent quantum control** in quantum computing.

### Physical Outcomes of Quantum Measurement

| **Quantum Platform** | **Measurement Mechanism** | **Observable Outcome** | **Key Points / Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Superconducting Qubits**            | **Dispersive Readout** <br> (cQED architecture) | - Shift in resonance frequency (phase/amplitude change of probe tone) <br> - Often measured via the readout resonators consisting of short superconducting transmission lines that are coupled to a feedline wired to an output, which is wired to a quantum-limited parametric amplifier and typically a high gain, high electron mobility transistor amplifier (HEMT), etc. | - Qubit and resonator are detuned (dispersive regime), leading to a qubit-state-dependent frequency shift $(\pm \chi)$. <br> - Detecting transmitted/reflected microwave signal reveals whether the qubit is in $\lvert 1\rangle$ or $\lvert 0\rangle$. <br> - The measurement “collapses” the qubit state, producing a classical result that can be digitized. | 
| **Trapped Ions**                       | **Fluorescence Detection** <br> (e.g., electron shelving technique) | - Presence or absence of emitted photons (fluorescence) | - A laser tuned to an electronic transition lights up one qubit state (“bright”) while another remains dark. <br> - Counting photons above a threshold indicates $\lvert 1\rangle$ or $\lvert 0\rangle$, collapsing the ion’s internal state. <br> - Non-resonant states do not fluoresce, providing a clear binary readout. | 
| **Semiconductor Spin Qubits**          | **Spin-Dependent Tunneling / Spin Blockade** | - Electron tunneling current or charge sensor signal | - In gate-defined quantum dots, measuring the spin state uses energy-selective tunneling (e.g., Pauli spin blockade). <br> - A charge sensor (quantum point contact or single-electron transistor) detects whether an electron tunnels, indicating spin-up vs. spin-down. <br> - This process effectively “collapses” the spin state upon measurement. | 
| **NV Centers in Diamond**             | **Optical Fluorescence Readout** | - Photoluminescence intensity (count rate)                                                                                                 | - The spin state of the NV center (e.g., $(\lvert m_s = 0\rangle)$ vs. $(\lvert m_s = 1\rangle)$ affects the optical emission levels under laser illumination. <br> - Detecting the photoluminescence intensity indicates the spin state. <br> - Measurement collapses the NV center’s ground-state spin wave function into a definite eigenstate. |
| **Photonic Qubits**                    | **Single-Photon Detection / Homodyne Measurement** | - Detector “click” (photon arrival) <br> or continuous variable amplitude/phase | - In single-photon approaches, a photon counter (e.g., avalanche photodiode, superconducting nanowire) registers a detection event, collapsing the photonic mode. <br> - In continuous-variable systems, homodyne or heterodyne detection measures quadratures of the electromagnetic field, giving classical measurement outcomes that reveal quantum state information. |
| **Neutral Atoms / Rydberg Atoms**      | **State-Selective Resonant Imaging / Fluorescence** | - Photon emission or ionization detection | - Similar to trapped ions, a resonant laser can cause one hyperfine state to scatter photons (“bright”), while another remains dark. <br> - Rydberg atoms may also be ionized and detected in a channeltron or micro-channel plate detector. The presence/absence of an ion indicates the atomic state. <br> - The measurement outcome collapses the atomic qubit to a definite state in the chosen basis. |
| **Superconducting Flux or Phase Qubits** | **Switching Current / Flux Detection** | - Change in the current-voltage characteristics of the readout circuit | - While cQED dispersive readout is common, some older or specialized superconducting designs measure flux qubits by detecting shifts in the SQUID magnetization or critical current. <br> - The wave function collapse is reflected in whether the circuit remains in a superconducting state or switches to a normal resistive state. |

> Expanded Explanation of Key Ideas: 

1. **Wave Function Collapse**  
   - In the Copenhagen interpretation, a quantum system (e.g., a qubit) is described by a superposition of states until it is measured.  
   - **Collapse** means the superposition is projected into an eigenstate of the measured observable, producing a classical result.  

2. **Dispersive Readout (Superconducting)**  
   - The qubit–resonator system is designed so the qubit’s state modifies the resonator frequency slightly (the dispersive shift, $(\chi)$.  
   - A microwave probe tone is sent through or reflected from the resonator, and the measured amplitude or phase shift reveals whether the qubit was $\lvert 0\rangle$ or $\lvert 1\rangle$.

3. **Variety of Measurement Mechanisms**  
   - **Trapped Ions**: Laser-induced fluorescence, where one qubit state fluoresces strongly and the other does not.  
   - **Semiconductor Spin Qubits**: Charge sensing or spin blockade, often measured via a quantum point contact or single-electron transistor.  
   - **NV Centers**: Optical readout of spin states via photoluminescence differences.  
   - **Photonic Qubits**: Single-photon counters or homodyne detection, collapsing the photonic state.  
   - **Neutral Atoms**: Fluorescence or ionization detection for Rydberg states.  

4. **Outcome vs. Interpretation**  
   - Although each platform’s **physical outcome** is different (fluorescence photons, current pulses, microwave phase shift, etc.), the conceptual step of mapping a quantum state to a classical result is the same.
   - Each row describes a distinct platform or approach, the typical **measurement mechanism**, and the **observable outcome** that corresponds to the qubit’s final state (often $\lvert 0\rangle$, $\lvert 1\rangle$, or some multi-qubit extension).   

5. **Measurement Fidelity & Qubit Readout**  
   - Designing a **high-fidelity measurement** is crucial for scalable quantum computing, ensuring that the classical outcome accurately reflects the qubit’s true state.  
   - Techniques like **Josephson parametric amplification** in superconducting circuits reduce measurement noise, enabling single-shot readout.

> Layout of an IBM Quantum System 1 (IBM Research).

A quantum computing system can be described by the quantum stack, containing levels of abstraction. The software layer exists on the upper level, while the hardware layer is on the lower level. At the very bottom of this hardware level is the quantum chip, which comprises of a quantum processing unit (QPU). One may notice, in nearly every quantum computing platform, the processor comes in some form of a chip. It contains components that can exploit quantum effects depending on the material's physical properties. The overall control and conversion systems vary in size, however. Some can fit inside a desktop machine, while others take up the space of an entire building room, like early vacuum tube-based computers.

The DiVincenzo criteria is a guide that can be used to realize gate-based quantum computation, of which effects like quantum interference, entanglement, and superposition are highly important. Physical quantum bits (qubits) are primary components for making quantum logic gates, along with their controllers, converters, couplers, readout connectors, etc. To build these devices requires materials that are shapeable and can be patterned into useful objects, typically, a few nanometers thick. These are what we call nanoscale thin films. Many materials used in fabricating thin film devices for quantum are compatible with existing semiconductor fabrication tools (i.e., lithography, thin film deposition, and dry etching equipment).

DiVincenzo Criteria:

1. Scalable architecture containing well-defined qubits.
2. Distinct and reliable qubit state preparation.
3. Decoherence times much longer than gate operation times.
4. Universal set of quantum gates that perform accurate operations on the qubits.
5. Well defined readout capability for each individual qubit.

Physical qubits are a two-level system and can be made of solid-state or non-solid-state devices. This means that the single atoms or clusters of atoms or molecules being used to make a useful qubit can exist in either a solid form of matter or a non-solid (photons, in this case). Devices based on superconducting junctions, quantum dots, nitrogen vacancies, and topological systems are of the solid-state type. Here, solid-state quantum devices will be highlighted. (In the future, we can expect more quantum platforms made of different solid-state materials that are also compatible with the latest manufacturing techniques, so keep this in mind).

In recent decades, nanofabrication techniques have made controllable quantum devices a reality, although quantum devices are not necessarily a sub-field of nanotechnology. It is widely acknowledged that device sizes from 1 to 100 nanometers ( 10 to 1,000 Ångstroms) are of the nanoscale. In this range, it is widely known that quantum effects are more likely to occur and are more observable in measurement. (Measurement is usually performed physically or converted into an electronic signal that can be easily recorded for analysis to confirm quantum behavior). As a result, many fabricated quantum devices are made of nanometer structures, typically in the vertical direction. One can make a quantum device that uses $<100$ nanometers of individual layer thickness
in the vertical direction while having micrometer dimensions in the lateral direction or one with $<100$ nanometer dimensions for both vertical and lateral directions.

For nanoscale features, optical (light) microscopes have difficulty in imaging, physically limited by the wavelength of light. Thus, an electron microscope or other specialized imaging system which uses wavelengths shorter than light are needed to properly view nanoscale objects while engineering a device.

The word "lithography" comes from the German word "lithographie," a combination of the ancient Greek words líthos, meaning "stone," and gráphein, meaning "to write." In the context of nanotechnology manufacturing, lithography is referred to as the development of so-called oneand two-dimensional structures. Here, at least one of its dimensions is in the nanometer range. Lithography allows one to copy patterns from computer generated designs onto an underlying substrate with a compatible adhesion layer. (A substrate is a type of supporting foundation, usually a wafer, while an adhesion layer promotes bonding between the substrate and film of interest). There are two sub-categories of lithography: masked and maskless. One may also hear the term direct-write, which refers to maskless exposure techniques. The masked exposure technique is basically like using a stencil, which allows one to draw designs repeatedly onto a surface by guiding a writing source through cut-out patterns.

General lithography is further divided into photolithography, electron-beam lithography, X-ray and extreme ultraviolet lithography, focused ion beam lithography and neutral atom beam lithography, soft lithography, colloidal lithography, nanopattern/ imprinting lithography, scanning (thermal) probe lithography, atomic force microscope lithography, etc. Each method involves energy exposure to a specific area with either the help of beam control systems or a patterned mask.

The two approaches for general manufacturing are called top-down, which involves cutting away pieces of a bulk material, and bottom-up, which involves growing or assembling atoms and molecules into larger structures. These two methods are applied in nanofabrication. Since thin film etching is a top-down process, while thin film growth and nanomolding is a bottom-up process, lithography is considered to be a hybrid method since it can use either or both processes. Nanomanipulation and nanoimprinting are examples of mostly bottom-up fabrication techniques. Dry (physical) etching and wet (chemical) etching methods correlate to anisotropic and isotropic profiles, respectively. (A profile or side profile is referred to as a cross-sectional view).

Vacuum deposition chambers, their support systems, and interfaces can be seen in fabrication laboratories virtually everywhere. The two main types of deposition chambers are physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition. These systems support the growth of material multilayers on sample substrates, such as $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ or MgO wafers. Common deposition techniques include sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, electroplating, and electron-beam evaporation, just to name a few. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, complexity, reliability, scalability, application, and deposition rates. One may also hear the term stack engineering, which refers to the research and development on the improvement of thin film performance. Additionally, lithography, deposition, and etching of thin films can be predicted or simulated with physics-informed modeling using premade paid software or a scientific programming language such as Python. (Examples can be found on the GitHub platform). The computed results can then be 3D animated and analyzed to help inform parameters used on real nanofabrication equipment, with the added benefit of cost-savings.

Improving nanotechnology manufacturing methods enables innovative approaches for solving quantum hardware problems every day. To develop quantum devices, it usually begins
with an idea on paper, where a device circuit or cross-sectional diagram of one eventually will become a real chip. One may choose to hand draw the ideas. Then, once the overall device function is principally understood, it can be translated to a software design application, such as Autodesk AutoCAD. Geometries can be modified and drawn to-scale on the software so that layers of the chip can overlap, interface, or connect with each other as intended. In more complicated designs, the steps can be programmed and automated using layout processing software.

From here, the design can easily be converted into a machine code by exporting specific file formats, with coordinates that a lithography machine can understand. The converted design file creates a virtually marked pathway to guide or control the beam or write head in a lithography machine. However, before it is uploaded for lithography, it should pass inspection for quality assurance and troubleshooting. Afterwards, the final machine code for patterning can be uploaded. From here, a prepared sample containing necessary (thin film) material layers for devices can be loaded for proper lithography alignment and exposure for polymerization.

When the initial lithography step is completed, the sample will be ready for etching, followed by deposition and planarization of required dielectrics, metals, or non-metal layers until the devices are finished and ready for testing. Sometimes, an extra step to add a device to a larger chip architecture or packaging is performed, including wire bonding. In the many pictures of quantum devices and processors you may find by means of the internet or in books, the exposed wire bonds and leads can be seen connecting the chip to its packaging. It is the typical appearance of a finished test sample. For industrial-scale quantum device samples that are being mass manufactured, wire bonded components are sealed within the packaging, like the case with classical semiconductor chips. For high-density quantum chips, the packaging interface may
involve bump bonding with superconducting metal that remains malleable under cryogenic conditions, such as indium for example.

Notice that the general process described above is very similar to the scenario for 3D printing or computer numerical control (CNC) machining. (It involves design files that are converted into G-codes, which guide the printer or milling heads to their locations on a printing or milling stage, using $\mathrm{X}-\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{Z}$ coordinates. Coordinates are just the numerical values that are mapped out on a surface, layer-by-layer).

> (Note: an inspection process is typically implemented at the end of each step).

If one wanted to visualize the engineering of atoms into nanostructures that can support quantum information systems, below are some ideas for intuition. The entire fabrication process is like preparing a multi-layered bakery item (e.g., cake), which gets sliced up into pieces and sculpted into arbitrary 3D shapes. (In the supplementary images, you can see an example of how a cake is formed into unique shapes by this description). Another analogy for the process of nanofabrication is the stacking of LEGO bricks, which too can be separated into groups of unique shapes. As a metaphor, each individual brick is the representation of an atom, some of which are slightly larger than others, yet still interlinkable overall.

By examining a close-up of atoms through an imaging system that supports atomic resolution modes, one can observe arrangements of dots. These dots displayed on such a microscope (e.g., transmission electron microscope or scanning tunneling microscope) are more like representations of atoms, based on the interaction of electrons around each atom with the beam or probe being used to scan a sample. Although you cannot distinguish between individual electrons or components of the nuclei in each atom being scanned in the microscope, it is possible to measure things like interatomic spacing and crystallinity. In other words, one can choose to inspect nanostructures of fabricated samples using atomic resolution imaging techniques to check on how organized or unorganized its atoms are.

It is useful to combine electron imaging with other surface analysis methods to doublecheck on how well atomic layers will adhere or interface with each other. Diffusion barriers, tunnel barriers, and blockades are also closely inspected using the above-mentioned techniques in solidstate nanostructures. These layers typically exist at device interfaces and serve the purpose of filtering out states or impurities that may move from region to region based on applied heat, voltage, current, field, etc. Therefore, it is worth performing a cross-sectional inspection of the multilayers before patterning and optionally after a prototype chip has been patterned.

In conclusion, nanotechnology is a highly interdisciplinary STEM field that is applicable to quantum technology yet does not contain quantum as a specific sub-category. It is an indispensable tool for realizing the platforms that host quantum information systems and processing. On the other hand, quantum technology as a field does contain a sub-category in hardware that covers nanotechnology and its related applications. This is where quantum chips and devices are discussed. To build the chip hardware at the bottom of the quantum stack requires an understanding of manufacturing at the atomic and nanoscale. Precision control and fine tuning of systems are key ideas of the intersection between both technologies. They can be leveraged to meet the sustainability needs of tomorrow and the distant future.
