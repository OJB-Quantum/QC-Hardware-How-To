\large{This document is meant to provide some level of consolidation for those desiring to be involved with quantum hardware engineering. By doing one's best to maintain familiarity with these topics, it is possible to become one who designs, builds, tests, operates, and maintains real quantum machines - a quantum mechanic. Another possibility is to begin working on a doctorate degree in the field with these training resources on hand. Please note that open access is a key theme held herein. Enjoy. -Onri
